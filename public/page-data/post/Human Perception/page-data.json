This robustness to variation is a\\n hallmark of human perception. On the other hand, we are susceptible to \\nillusions: We might fail to distinguish between sounds or images that \\nare, in fact, different. Scientists have explained many of these \\nillusions, but we lack a full understanding of the invariances in our \\nauditory and visual systems.  We know that humans perceive data, but we are  not as sure of how we perceive. We know that visualizations present data that is then perceived, but how are these visualizations perceived? How do we know that our visual representations are not interpreted differently by different viewers? How can we be sure that the data we present  is understood? We study perception to better control the presentation of data, and eventually to harness human perception.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"}],\"nodeType\":\"document\"}"}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
