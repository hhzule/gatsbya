Students in Tibet face arrest for posting\\n on the site, but many escape to blog about their experiences in exile. \\nWith a history of direct action, the group is now uniting worldwide \\nmembers through the web, blogging to spread word of news and protests, \\nand using sites like Facebook to raise funds. The organisation, which \\nwas founded in 1994 in New York, spans more than 35 countries and gets \\nup to 100,000 hits a month. In 2006, SFT used a satellite link at Mount \\nEverest base camp to stream live footage on to YouTube of a \\ndemonstration against Chinese Olympic athletes practising carrying the \\ntorch there. Later this year the web will be a critical tool in \\norganising and reporting protests during the games. 'SFT plans to stage \\nprotests in Beijing during the games and post blogs as events unfold,' \\nsays Iain Thom, the SFT UK national co-ordinator. 'But for security \\nreasons we can't reveal details of how or where yet.' Similarly, a \\nmassive protest in London on 10 March will be the subject of intense \\ncyber comment. In response, the site has fallen victim to increasingly \\nsophisticated cyber attacks. Investigations have traced the sources back\\n to China, leading to speculation that the Chinese authorities are \\ntrying to sabotage the site to stop online critics.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"}],\"nodeType\":\"document\"}"}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
